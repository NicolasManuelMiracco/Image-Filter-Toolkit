# Image-Filter-Toolkit

One-line description: A Python library for applying image filters like sepia and negative, including visualization and testing.

Summary: This Python script demonstrates the use of PIL, NumPy, and Matplotlib to create and apply image filters such as sepia and negative to images. 
The `apply_sepia` function transforms an image to sepia tone using a matrix multiplication approach, while the `apply_negative` function inverts the image colors to produce a negative effect. Both functions include a visual comparison of the original and processed images. 
Additionally, the script incorporates a test case using pytest to ensure the sepia function's correctness by comparing the processed image against a reference. 
The example usage shows how to load, process, and visualize images, providing a complete toolkit for image filtering in Python.
